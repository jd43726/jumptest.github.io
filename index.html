        <p>CSS Grid is a technology that allows you to create layouts using a 2 dimensional grid system, one that uses
            both colu<mns and rows. This technology has been implemented in most browsers and is makes creating layouts
                a lot easier.</p> <p>CSS grid has two main concepts, defining the grid container itself and interacting
                with the grid items.</p>

        <p>The grid container is what defines a grid and is the parent element of the grid container. You cannot use CSS
            Grid without having at least one container. To make an element a container, simply add the display: grid to
            the element that will be the container.

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
